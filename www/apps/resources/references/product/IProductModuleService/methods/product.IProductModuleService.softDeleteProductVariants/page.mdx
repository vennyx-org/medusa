# softDeleteProductVariants - Product Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `softDeleteProductVariants` method. This belongs to the Product Module.

This method is used to delete variants. Unlike the delete method, this method won't completely remove the variant. It can still be accessed or retrieved using methods like retrieve if you pass the `withDeleted` property to the `config` object parameter.

The soft-deleted variants can be restored using the restore method.

## Example

```ts
await productModuleService.softDeleteProductVariants([
  "variant_123",
  "variant_321",
])
```
