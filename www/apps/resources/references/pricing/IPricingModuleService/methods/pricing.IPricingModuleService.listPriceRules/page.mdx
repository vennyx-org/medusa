# listPriceRules - Pricing Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listPriceRules` method. This belongs to the Pricing Module.

This method is used to retrieve a paginated list of price rules based on optional filters and configuration.

## Example

To retrieve a list of price rules using their IDs:

```ts
const priceRules = await pricingModuleService.listPriceRules({
  id: ["prule_123", "prule_321"],
})
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the price rules:

```ts
const priceRules = await pricingModuleService.listPriceRules(
  {
    id: ["prule_123", "prule_321"],
  },
  {
    relations: ["price_set"],
  }
)
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
const priceRules = await pricingModuleService.listPriceRules(
  {
    id: ["prule_123", "prule_321"],
  },
  {
    relations: ["price_set"],
    take: 20,
    skip: 2,
  }
)
```
