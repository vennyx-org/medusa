In this chapter, you'll learn how subscribers receive an event's data payload.

## Access Event's Data Payload

When events are emitted, they’re emitted with a data payload. 

The object that the subscriber function receives as a parameter has an `event` property, which is an object holding the event payload in a `data` property with additional context.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["7", "event", "The event details."],
  ["8", "{ id: string }", "The type of expected data payloads."],
]

```ts title="src/subscribers/product-created.ts" highlights={highlights} collapsibleLines="1-5" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import type {
  SubscriberArgs,
  SubscriberConfig,
} from "@medusajs/framework"

export default async function productCreateHandler({
  event,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  const productId = event.data.id
  console.log(`The product ${productId} was created`)
}

export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: "product.created",
}
```

The `event` object has the following properties:

<TypeList types={[
  {
    name: "data",
    type: "`object`",
    description: "The data payload of the event. Its properties are different for each event."
  },
  {
    name: "name",
    type: "string",
    description: "The name of the triggered event."
  },
  {
    name: "metadata",
    type: "`object`",
    description: "Additional data and context of the emitted event.",
    optional: true
  },
]} sectionTitle="Access Event's Data Payload" />

This logs the product ID received in the `product.created` event’s data payload to the console.
