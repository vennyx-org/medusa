In this chapter, you’ll learn about modules, their main service, and how to create them.

## What is a Module?

A module is a package of reusable commerce or architectural functionalities. It's integrated as a building block in your Medusa application, without implications on the existing setup.

You create a module to introduce custom features, extend existing ones, or integrate third-party services.

## How to Create a Module?

<Note title="Steps Summary">

1. Create module's main service.
2. Create module definition.
3. Add module to Medusa's configurations.

</Note>

Modules are created in a sub-directory of `src/modules`.

For example, create the directory `src/modules/hello`.

### 1. Create Main Service

A module must define a service. A service is a TypeScript or JavaScript class used to perform actions on the database or connect to third-party services.

A service must be defined at the root of your module directory under `service.ts` filename.

For example, create the file `src/modules/hello/service.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/modules/hello/service.ts"
export default class HelloModuleService {
  async getMessage() {
    return "Hello, world!"
  }
}
```

### 2. Export Module Definition

A module must have an `index.ts` file in its root directory that exports its definition. The definition specifies the main service of the module.

For example, create the file `src/modules/hello/index.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/modules/hello/index.ts" highlights={[["7", "", "The main service of the module."]]}
import HelloModuleService from "./service"
import { Module } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export const HELLO_MODULE = "helloModuleService"

export default Module(HELLO_MODULE, {
  service: HelloModuleService,
})
```

You use the `Module` function imported from `@medusajs/framework/utils` to create the module definition. It requires two parameters:

1. The module's name.
2. An object with a required property `service` indicating the module's main service.

### 3. Add Module to Configurations

The last step is to add the module in Medusa’s configurations.

In `medusa-config.js`, add a `modules` property and pass to it your custom module:

```js title="medusa-config.js" highlights={[["7", "helloModuleService", "The key of the main service to be registered in the Medusa container."]]}
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    // ...
  },
  modules: {
    helloModuleService: {
      resolve: "./modules/hello",
    },
  },
})
```

Its key (`helloModuleService`) is the name of the module’s main service. It will be registered in the Medusa container with that name.

<Note title="Tip">

It should also be the same name passed as the first parameter to the `Module` function in the module's definition.

</Note>

Its value is an object having the `resolve` property, whose value is either a path to module's directory relative to `src`(it shouldn't include `src` in the path), or an `npm` package’s name.

## Test the Module

Since the module's main service is registered in the Medusa container, you can resolve it in other resources to use its methods.

<Note title="Tip">

Resolving a module's service is essential to use its methods that perform actions on the database or connect to a third-party service.

</Note>

For example, create the API route `src/api/custom/route.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/api/custom/route.ts"
import { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import HelloModuleService from "../../modules/hello/service"
import { HELLO_MODULE } from "../../modules/hello"

export async function GET(
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
): Promise<void> {
  const helloModuleService: HelloModuleService = req.scope.resolve(
    HELLO_MODULE
  )

  res.json({
    message: await helloModuleService.getMessage(),
  })
}
```

Then, start the Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Finally, send a `GET` request to `/custom`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/custom
```

You’ll receive the following response:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, world!"
}
```

## When to Use Modules

<Note title="Use modules when" type="success">

- You're implementing a custom commerce feature. For example, you're implementing digital products.
- You want to re-use your custom commerce functionalities across Medusa applications or use them in other environments, such as Edge functions and Next.js apps.
