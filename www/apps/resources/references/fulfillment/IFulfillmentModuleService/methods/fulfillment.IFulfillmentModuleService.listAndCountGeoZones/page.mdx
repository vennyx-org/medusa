# listAndCountGeoZones - Fulfillment Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listAndCountGeoZones` method. This belongs to the Fulfillment Module.

This method retrieves a paginated list of geo zones along with the total count of available geo zones satisfying the provided filters.

## Example

To retrieve a list of geo zones using their IDs:

```ts
const [geoZones, count] =
  await fulfillmentModuleService.listAndCountGeoZones({
    id: ["fgz_123", "fgz_321"],
  })
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the geo zone:

```ts
const [geoZones, count] =
  await fulfillmentModuleService.listAndCountGeoZones(
    {
      id: ["fgz_123", "fgz_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["service_zone"],
    }
  )
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
const [geoZones, count] =
  await fulfillmentModuleService.listAndCountGeoZones(
    {
      id: ["fgz_123", "fgz_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["service_zone"],
      take: 20,
      skip: 2,
    }
  )
```
