# listProductCollections - Product Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listProductCollections` method. This belongs to the Product Module.

This method is used to retrieve a paginated list of product collections based on optional filters and configuration.

## Example

To retrieve a list of product collections using their IDs:

```ts
const collections =
  await productModuleService.listProductCollections({
    id: ["pcol_123", "pcol_321"],
  })
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the product collections:

```ts
const collections =
  await productModuleService.listProductCollections(
    {
      id: ["pcol_123", "pcol_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["products"],
    }
  )
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
const collections =
  await productModuleService.listProductCollections(
    {
      id: ["pcol_123", "pcol_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["products"],
      take: 20,
      skip: 2,
    }
  )
```
