      - You're implementing a custom commerce feature. For example, you're implementing digital products.
      - You want to extend data models in other commerce modules, such as adding a field or a relation to the Product model.
      - You want to re-use your custom commerce functionalities across Medusa applications or use them in other environments, such as Edge functions and Next.js apps.

      - You want to store simple key-value pairs related to a Medusa data model. Instead, use the `metadata` field that models have, which is an object of custom key-value pairs.

      - You're performing an action at application start-up.
      - You're establishing a one-time connection with an external system.

      <Table.Cell>
      
      - You want to perform an action continuously or at a set time pattern in the application. Use scheduled jobs instead.

      - You're executing an action at a specified time interval during application runtime.
      - The action must be executed automatically.
      
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
      
      - You want the action to execute at a specified time interval while the Medusa application **isn't** running. Instead, use the operating system's equivalent of a cron job.
      - You want to execute the action once. Use loaders instead.
      - You want to execute the action if an event occurs. Use subscribers instead.

      <Table.Cell>
      
      - You're defining a flow with interactions across multiple systems and services.
      - You're defining flows to be used across different resources. For example, if you want to invoke the flow manually through an API Router, but also want to automate its running through a scheduled job.
      - You want to define how the series of actions are rolled-back when an error occurs.
