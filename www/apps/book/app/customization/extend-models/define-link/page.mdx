<Note title="Example Chapter">

This chapter covers how to define a link between the `Brand` and `Product`data models as a step of the ["Extend Models" chapter](../page.mdx).

## 1. Define the Link Between Product and Brand

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      text: "Brand Module having a Brand data model",
      link: "/customization/custom-features/module"
    }
  ]}
/>

Links are defined in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under the `src/links` directory. The file defines and exports the link using the `defineLink` function imported from `@medusajs/utils`.

So, create the file `src/links/product-brand.ts` with the following content:

export const highlights = [
  ["7", "linkable", "Special `linkable` property that holds the linkable data models of `ProductModule`."],
  ["10", "linkable", "Special `linkable` property that holds the linkable data models of `BrandModule`."],
]

```ts title="src/links/product-brand.ts" highlights={highlights}
import BrandModule from "../modules/brand"
import ProductModule from "@medusajs/product"
import { defineLink } from "@medusajs/utils"

export default defineLink(
  {
    linkable: ProductModule.linkable.product,
    isList: true,
  },
  BrandModule.linkable.brand
)
```

The `defineLink` function accepts two parameters, each specifying the link configurations of each data model.

Modules have a special `linkable` property that holds the data models' link configurations.

`defineLink` accepts for each parameter either:

- The data model's link configuration;
- Or an object that has two properties:
    - `linkable`: the link configuration of the data model.
    - `isList`: Whether many records of the data model can be linked to the other model.

So, in the above code snippet, you define a link between the `Product` and `Brand` data models. Since `isList` is enabled on the product's side, a brand can be associated with multiple products.

## 2. Sync the Link to the Database

To reflect your link in the database, run the `db:sync-links` command:

```bash
npx medusa db:sync-links
```

This creates a table for the link in the database. The table stores the IDs of linked brand and product records.

<Note title="Tip">

You can also use the `db:migrate` command, which both runs the migrations and syncs the links.

## Next: Link Brand and Product Records

In the next chapter, you'll learn how to associate brand and product records by creating a link between them.
