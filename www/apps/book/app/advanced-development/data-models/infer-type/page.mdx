In this chapter, you'll learn how to infer the type of a data model.

## How to Infer Type of Data Model?

Consider you have a `MyCustom` data model. You can't reference this data model in a type, such as a workflow input or service method output types, since it's a variable.

Instead, Medusa provides an `InferTypeOf` utility imported from `@medusajs/framework/types` that transforms your data model to a type.

For example:

```ts
import { InferTypeOf } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import { MyCustom } from "../models/my-custom" // relative path to the model

export type MyCustom = InferTypeOf<typeof MyCustom>
```

The `InferTypeOf` utility accepts as a type argument the type of the data model.

Since the `MyCustom` data model is a variable, use the `typeof` operator to pass the data model as a type argument to `InferTypeOf`.

You can now use the `MyCustom` type to reference a data model in other types, such as in workflow inputs or service method outputs:

```ts title="Example Service"
// other imports...
import { InferTypeOf } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import { MyCustom } from "../models/my-custom"

type MyCustom = InferTypeOf<typeof MyCustom>

class HelloModuleService extends MedusaService({ MyCustom }) {
  async doSomething(): Promise<MyCustom> {
    // ...
  }
}
```
