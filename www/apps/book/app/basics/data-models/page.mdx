In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn what data models are and how to create a data model.

## What is a Data Model?

A data model is a class that represents a table in the database.

A data model is created in a module, and its record are managed in the database using the module's service.

---

## How to Create a Data Model?

A data model is created in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under a module's `models` directory. It's defined using the `model` utility imported from `@medusajs/framework/utils`.

For example, create the file `src/modules/hello/models/my-custom.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/modules/hello/models/my-custom.ts"
import { model } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const MyCustom = model.define("my_custom", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  name: model.text(),
})

export default MyCustom
```

You define a data model using the `model`'s `define` method. It accepts two parameters:

1. The first one is the name of the data model's table in the database. It should be in snake-case form.
2. The second is an object, which is the data model's schema. The schema's properties are defined using the `model`'s methods.

The example above defines the data model `MyCustom` with the properties `id` and `name`. 

### Generate a Migration

A migration is a TypeScript or JavaScript file that defines changes to be made in the database, such as creating a new table or updating it.

To generate a migration for the data models in your module, run the following command:

```bash
npx medusa db:generate helloModuleService
```

The `db:generate` command of the Medusa CLI accepts one or more module names to generate the migration for.

The module name (for example, `helloModuleService`) is the key used when registering the module in the `modules` configuration in `medusa-config.js`.

The above command creates a migration file at the directory `src/modules/hello/migrations` similar to the following:

```ts
import { Migration } from "@mikro-orm/migrations"

export class Migration20240702105919 extends Migration {

  async up(): Promise<void> {
    this.addSql("create table if not exists \"my_custom\" (\"id\" text not null, \"name\" text not null, \"created_at\" timestamptz not null default now(), \"updated_at\" timestamptz not null default now(), \"deleted_at\" timestamptz null, constraint \"my_custom_pkey\" primary key (\"id\"));")
  }

  async down(): Promise<void> {
    this.addSql("drop table if exists \"my_custom\" cascade;")
  }

}
```

In the migration class, the `up` method creates the table `my_custom` and defines its columns. The `down` method drops the table.

<Note>

Data models automatically have the date properties `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at`.

</Note>

### Run Migration

To reflect the changes in the generated migration file, run the `migration` command:

```bash
npx medusa db:migrate
```

If ran successfully, the `my_custom` table will be created in the database.

## When to Use Data Models

<Note title="Use data models when" type="success">

You want to store data related to your customization in the database.

</Note>

<Note title="Don't use data models if" type="error">

You want to store simple key-value pairs related to an existing data model. Instead, use the `metadata` field that most existing models have, which is an object of custom key-value pairs.

</Note>
