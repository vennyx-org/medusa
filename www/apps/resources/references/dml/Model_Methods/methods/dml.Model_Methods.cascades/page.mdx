# cascades Method - API Reference

This method configures which related data models an operation, such as deletion,
should be cascaded to.

For example, if a store is deleted, its product should also be deleted.

## Example

```ts
import { model } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const Store = model.define("store", {
  id: model.id(),
  products: model.hasMany(() => Product),
})
.cascades({
  delete: ["products"],
})
```
