  summary: Validate Authentication Callback
  description: >
    This API route is used by your storefront or frontend application when a
    third-party provider redirects to it after authentication. 


    It validates the authentication with the third-party provider and, if
    successful, returns an authentication token.


    You can decode the JWT token using libraries like
    [react-jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jwt) in the storefront. If
    the decoded data doesn't  have an `actor_id` property, then you must
    register the customer using the Create Customer API route passing the token
    in the request's Authorization header.
