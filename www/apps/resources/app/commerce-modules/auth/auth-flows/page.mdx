In this document, you'll learn how to use the Auth Module's main service's methods to implement authentication flows and reset a user's password.

## Authentication Methods

### Register

The [register method of the Auth Module's main service](/references/auth/register) creates an auth identity that can be authenticated later.

For example:

```ts
const data = await authModuleService.register(
  "emailpass",
  // passed to auth provider
  {
    // ...
  }
)
```

This method calls the `register` method of the provider specified in the first parameter and returns its data.

### Authenticate

To authenticate a user, you use the [authenticate method of the Auth Module's main service](/references/auth/authenticate). For example:

```ts
const data = await authModuleService.authenticate(
  "emailpass",
  // passed to auth provider
  {
    // ...
  }
)
```

This method calls the `authenticate` method of the provider specified in the first parameter and returns its data.

## Auth Flow 1: Basic Authentication

The basic authentication flow requires first using the `register` method, then the `authenticate` method:

```ts
const { success, authIdentity } = await authModuleService.register(
  "emailpass",
  // passed to auth provider
  {
    // ...
  }
)

// later (can be another route for log-in)
const { success, authIdentity, location } = await authModuleService.authenticate(
  "emailpass",
  // passed to auth provider
  {
    // ...
  }
)

if (success && !location) {
  // user is authenticated
}
```

If `success` is true and `location` isn't set, the user is authenticated successfully, and their authentication details are available within the `authIdentity` object.

The next section explains the flow if `location` is set.

<Note>

Check out the [AuthIdentity](/references/auth/models/AuthIdentity) reference for the received properties in `authIdentity`.

## Auth Flow 2: Third-Party Service Authentication

The third-party service authentication method requires using the `authenticate` method first:

```ts
const { success, authIdentity, location } = await authModuleService.authenticate(
  "emailpass",
  // passed to auth provider
  {
    // ...
  }
)

if (location) {
  // return the location for the front-end to redirect to
}

if (!success) {
  // authentication failed
}

// authentication successful
```

If the `authenticate` method returns a `location` property, the authentication process requires the user to perform an action with a third-party service. So, you return the `location` to the front-end or client to redirect to that URL.

For example, when using the `google` provider, the `location` is the URL that the user is navigated to login.

### validateCallback

Providers handling this authentication flow must implement the `validateCallback` method. It implements the logic to validate the authentication with the third-party service.

So, once the user performs the required action with the third-party service (for example, log-in with Google), the frontend must redirect to an API route that uses the [validateCallback method of the Auth Module's main service](/references/auth/validateCallback).

The method calls the specified providerâ€™s `validateCallback` method passing it the authentication details it received in the second parameter:

```ts
const { success, authIdentity } = await authModuleService.validateCallback(
  "google",
  // passed to auth provider
  {
    // request data, such as
    url,
    headers,
    query,
    body,
    protocol,
  }
)

if (success) {
  // authentication succeeded
}
```

If the returned `success` property is `true`, the authentication with the third-party provider was successful.

## Reset Password

To update a user's password or other authentication details, use the `updateProvider` method of the Auth Module's main service. It calls the `update` method of the specified authentication provider.

For example:

```ts
const { success } = await authModuleService.update(
  "emailpass",
  // passed to the auth provider
  {
    email: "user@example.com",
    password: "supersecret",
  }
)

if (success) {
  // password reset successfully
}
```

The method accepts as a first parameter the ID of the provider, and as a second parameter the data necessary to reset the password.

In the example above, you use the `emailpass` provider, so you have to pass an object having an `email` and `password` properties.

If the returned `success` property is `true`, the password has reset successfully.
