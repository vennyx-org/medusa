<Note title="Example Chapter">

This chapter covers how to extend the Create Product API route to link a product to a brand as a step of the ["Extend Models" chapter](../page.mdx).

</Note>

## Additional Data in API Routes

Some API routes, including the [Create Product API route](https://docs.medusajs.com/v2/api/admin#products_postproducts), accept an `additional_data` request body parameter.

It's useful when you want to pass custom data, such as the brand ID, then perform an action based on this data, such as link the brand to the product.

---

## 1. Allow Passing the Brand ID in Additional Data

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      text: "Brand Module",
      link: "/customization/custom-features/module"
    },
    {
      text: "Defined link between the Brand and Product data models.",
      link: "/customization/extend-models/define-link"
    }
  ]}
/>

Before passing custom properties in the `additional_data` parameter, you add the property to `additional_data`'s validation rules.

Create the file `src/api/middlewares.ts`, which is a special file that defines middlewares or validation rules of custom properties passed in the `additional_data` parameter:

```ts title="src/api/middlewares.ts"
import { defineMiddlewares } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { z } from "zod"

export default defineMiddlewares({
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/admin/products",
      method: ["POST"],
      additionalDataValidator: {
        brand_id: z.string().optional(),
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

You use [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to add a validation rule to the `additional_data` parameter indicating that it can include a `brand_id` property of type string.

### defineMiddleware Parameters

The `defineMiddlewares` function accepts an object having a `routes` property. Its value is an array of middleware route objects, each having the following properties:

- `matcher`: a string or regular expression indicating the API route path to apply the middleware on. It must be compatible with [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp).
- `method`: An array of HTTP method to apply the middleware or additional data validation to. If not supplied, it's applied to all HTTP methods.
- `additionalDataValidator`: An object of key-value pairs defining the validation rules for custom properties using [Zod](https://zod.dev/).

## 2. Link Brand to Product using Workflow Hook

A workflow hook is a point in a workflow where you can inject a step to perform a custom functionality. This is useful to perform custom action in an API route's workflow.

The [createProductsWorkflow](!resources!/references/medusa-workflows/createProductsWorkflow) used in the Create Product API route has a `productsCreated` hook that runs after the product is created.

So, to consume the `productsCreated` hook, create the file `src/workflows/hooks/created-product.ts` with the following content:

export const hookHighlights = [
  ["7", "productsCreated", "Access the hook in the `hooks` property."],
  ["9", "", "Only proceed if the brand ID is passed in the additional data."],
  ["18", "retrieveBrand", "Try to retrieve the brand to ensure it exists."],
  ["27", "links", "Define an array to store the links in."],
  ["31", "push", "Add a link to be created."],
  ["41", "create", "Create the links."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/created-product.ts" highlights={hookHighlights}
import { createProductsWorkflow } from "@medusajs/core-flows"
import { StepResponse } from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"
import { Modules, ContainerRegistrationKeys } from "@medusajs/utils"
import { BRAND_MODULE } from "../../modules/brand"
import BrandModuleService from "../../modules/brand/service"

createProductsWorkflow.hooks.productsCreated(
  (async ({ products, additional_data }, { container }) => {
    if (!additional_data.brand_id) {
      return new StepResponse([], [])
    }

    // check that brand exists
    const brandModuleService: BrandModuleService = container.resolve(
      BRAND_MODULE
    )
    // if the brand doesn't exist, an error is thrown.
    await brandModuleService.retrieveBrand(additional_data.brand_id as string)

    const remoteLink = container.resolve(
      ContainerRegistrationKeys.REMOTE_LINK
    )
    const logger = container.resolve(
      ContainerRegistrationKeys.LOGGER
    )

    const links = []

    // link products to brands
    for (const product of products) {
      links.push({
        [Modules.PRODUCT]: {
          product_id: product.id,
        },
        [BRAND_MODULE]: {
          brand_id: additional_data.brand_id,
        },
      })
    }

    await remoteLink.create(links)

    logger.info("Linked brand to products")

    return new StepResponse(links, links)
  })
)
```

Workflows have a special `hooks` property to access its hooks and consume them. Each hook, such as `productCreated`, accept a step function as a parameter.

In the step, if a brand ID is passed in `additional_data` and the brand exists, you create a link between each product and the brand.

### Dismiss Links in Compensation

You can pass as a second parameter of the hook a compensation function that undoes what the step did.

Add the following compensation function as a second parameter:

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/created-product.ts"
createProductsWorkflow.hooks.productsCreated(
  // ...
  (async (links, { container }) => {
    if (!links.length) {
      return
    }

    const remoteLink = container.resolve(
      ContainerRegistrationKeys.REMOTE_LINK
    )

    await remoteLink.dismiss(links)
  })
)
```

In the compensation function, you dismiss the links created by the step using the `dismiss` method of the remote link.

## Test it Out

To test it out, first, retrieve the authentication token of your admin user by sending a `POST` request to `/auth/user/emailpass`:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/auth/user/emailpass' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email": "admin@medusa-test.com",
    "password": "supersecret"
}'
```

Make sure to replace the email and password with your user's credentials.

Then, send a `POST` request to `/admin/products` to create a product, and pass in the `additional_data` parameter a brand's ID:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/admin/products' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
--data '{
    "title": "Product 1",
    "additional_data": {
        "brand_id": "01J7AX9ES4X113HKY6C681KDZ2J"
    }
}'
```

<Note title="Tip">

Make sure to replace the `{token}` in the Authorization header with the token received from the previous request.

</Note>

In the request body, you pass in the `additional_data` parameter a `brand_id`.

The request creates a product and returns it.

In the Medusa application's logs, you'll find the message `Linked brand to products`, indicating that the workflow hook handler ran and linked the brand to the products.

## Worflows and API Routes References

Medusa exposes hooks in many of its workflows that you can consume to add custom logic.

The [Store](!api!/store) and [Admin](!api!/admin) API references indicate what workflows are used in each API routes. By clicking on the workflow, you access the [workflow's reference](!resources!/medusa-workflows-reference) where you can see the hooks available in the workflow.
