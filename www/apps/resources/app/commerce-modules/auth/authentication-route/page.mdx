# {metadata.title}

In this document, you'll learn about the authentication routes and how to use them to create and log-in users, and reset their password.

<Note>

These routes are added by Medusa's HTTP layer, not the Auth Module.

## Types of Authentication Flows

### 1. Basic Authentication Flow

This authentication flow doesn't require validation with third-party services.

<Note title="Example">

[How to register customer in storefront using basic authentication flow](../../../storefront-development/customers/register/page.mdx).

</Note>

The steps are:

![Diagram showcasing the basic authentication flow between the frontend and the Medusa application](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1725539370/Medusa%20Resources/basic-auth-routes_pgpjch.jpg)

1. Register the user with the [Register Route](#register-route).
5. Use the authentication token to create the user with their respective API route.
    - For example, for customers you would use the [Create Customer API route](!api!/store#customers_postcustomers).
    - For admin users, you accept an invite using the [Accept Invite API route](!api!/admin#invites_postinvitesaccept)
2. Authenticate the user with the [Auth Route](#auth-route).

After registration, you only use the [Auth Route](#auth-route) for subsequent authentication.

### 2. Third-Party Service Authenticate Flow

This authentication flow authenticates the user with a third-party service, such as Google.

<Note title="Example">

[How to authenticate customer with a third-party provider in the storefront.](../../../storefront-development/customers/third-party-login/page.mdx).

</Note>

It requires the following steps:

![Diagram showcasing the authentication flow between the frontend, Medusa application, and third-party service](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1725528159/Medusa%20Resources/Third_Party_Auth_tvf4ng.jpg)

1. Authenticate the user with the [Auth Route](#auth-route).
2. The auth route returns a URL to authenticate with third-party service, such as login with Google. The frontend (such as a storefront), when it receives a `location` property in the response, must redirect to the returned location.
3. Once the authentication with the third-party service finishes, it redirects back to the frontend with a `code` query parameter. So, make sure your third-party service is configured to redirect to your frontend page after successful authentication.
4. The frontend sends a request to the [Callback Route](#callback-route) passing the `code` query parameter.
5. If the callback validation is successful, the frontend receives the authentication token.
6. Decode the received token in the frontend using tools like [react-jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jwt).
    - If the decoded data has an `actor_id` property, then the user is already registered. So, use this token for subsequent authenticated requests.
    - If not, follow the rest of the steps.
7. The frontend uses the authentication token to create the user with their respective API route.
    - For example, for customers you would use the [Create Customer API route](!api!/store#customers_postcustomers).
    - For admin users, you accept an invite using the [Accept Invite API route](!api!/admin#invites_postinvitesaccept)
8. The frontend sends a request to the [Refresh Token Route](#refresh-token-route) to retrieve a new token with the user information populated.

## Register Route

The Medusa application defines an API route at `/auth/{actor_type}/{provider}/register` that creates an auth identity for an actor type, such as a `customer`. It returns a JWT token that you pass to an API route that creates the user.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/auth/{actor_type}/{providers}/register
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "email": "Whitney_Schultz@gmail.com"
  // ...
}'
```

<Note>

This API route is useful for providers like `emailpass` that uses custom logic to authenticate a user. For authentication providers that authenticate with third-party services, such as Google, use the [Auth Route](#auth-route) instead.

</Note>

For example, if you're registering a customer, you:

1. Send a request to `/auth/customer/emailpass/register` to retrieve the registration JWT token.
2. Send a request to the [Create Customer API route](!api!/store#customers_postcustomers) to create the customer, passing the [JWT token in the header](!api!/store#authentication).

### Path Parameters

Its path parameters are:

- `{actor_type}`: the actor type of the user you're authenticating. For example, `customer`.
- `{provider}`: the auth provider to handle the authentication. For example, `emailpass`.

### Request Body Parameters

This route accepts in the request body the data that the specified authentication provider requires to handle authentication.

For example, the EmailPass provider requires an `email` and `password` fields in the request body.

### Response Fields

If the authentication is successful, you'll receive a `token` field in the response body object:

```json
{
  "token": "..."
}
```

Use that token in the header of subsequent requests to send authenticated requests.

---

## Login Route

The Medusa application defines an API route at `/auth/{actor_type}/{provider}` that authenticates a user of an actor type. It returns a JWT token that can be passed in [the header of subsequent requests](!api!/store#authentication) to send authenticated requests.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/auth/{actor_type}/{providers}
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "email": "Whitney_Schultz@gmail.com"
  // ...
}'
```

For example, if you're authenticating a customer, you send a request to `/auth/customer/emailpass`.

### Path Parameters

Its path parameters are:

- `{actor_type}`: the actor type of the user you're authenticating. For example, `customer`.
- `{provider}`: the auth provider to handle the authentication. For example, `emailpass`.

### Request Body Parameters

This route accepts in the request body the data that the specified authentication provider requires to handle authentication.

For example, the EmailPass provider requires an `email` and `password` fields in the request body.

### Response Fields

If the authentication is successful, you'll receive a `token` field in the response body object:

```json
{
  "token": "..."
}
```

Use that token in the header of subsequent requests to send authenticated requests.

If the authentication requires more action with a third-party service, you'll receive a `location` property:

```json
{
  "location": "https://..."
}
```

Redirect to that URL in the frontend to continue the authentication process with the third-party service.

## Validate Callback Route

The Medusa application defines an API route at `/auth/{actor_type}/{provider}/callback` that's useful for validating the authentication callback or redirect from third-party services like Google.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/auth/{actor_type}/{providers}/callback?code=123
```

<Note title="Tip">

Refer to the [third-party authentication flow](#2-third-party-service-authenticate-flow) section to see how this route fits into the authentication flow.

</Note>

### Path Parameters

Its path parameters are:

- `{actor_type}`: the actor type of the user you're authenticating. For example, `customer`.
- `{provider}`: the auth provider to handle the authentication. For example, `google`.

### Query Parameters

This route accepts a `code` query parameter, which is the code received from the third-party provider.

### Response Fields

If the authentication is successful, you'll receive a `token` field in the response body object:

```json
{
  "token": "..."
}
```

In your frontend, decode the token using tools like [react-jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jwt):

- If the decoded data has an `actor_id` property, the user is already registered. So, use this token for subsequent authenticated requests.
- If not, use the token in the header of a request that creates the user, such as the [Create Customer API route](!api!/store#customers_postcustomers).

---

## Refresh Token Route

The Medusa application defines an API route at `/auth/token/refresh` that's useful after authenticating a user with a third-party service to populate the user's token with their new information.

It requires the user's JWT token that they received from the authentication or callback routes.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/auth/token/refresh \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
```

### Response Fields

If the token was refreshed successfully, you'll receive a `token` field in the response body object:

```json
{
  "token": "..."
}
```

Use that token in the header of subsequent requests to send authenticated requests.

---

## Reset Password Routes

To reset a user's password:

1. Generate a token using the [Generate Reset Password Token API route](#generate-reset-password-token-route).
    - The API route emits the `auth.password_reset` event, passing the token in the payload.
    - You can create a subscriber, as seen in [this guide](../reset-password/page.mdx), that listens to the event and send a notification to the user.
2. Pass the token to the [Reset Password API route](#reset-password-route) to reset the password.
    - The URL in the user's notification should direct them to a frontend URL, which sends a request to this route.

<Note title="Example">

[Storefront Development: How to Reset a Customer's Password.](../../../storefront-development/customers/reset-password/page.mdx)

</Note>

### Generate Reset Password Token Route

The Medusa application defines an API route at `/auth/{actor_type}/{auth_provider}/reset-password` that emits the `auth.password_reset` event, passing the token in the payload.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/auth/{actor_type}/{providers}/reset-password
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "identifier": "Whitney_Schultz@gmail.com"
}'
```

<Note>

This API route is useful for providers like `emailpass` that store a user's password and use it for authentication.

</Note>

#### Path Parameters

Its path parameters are:

- `{actor_type}`: the actor type of the user you're authenticating. For example, `customer`.
- `{provider}`: the auth provider to handle the authentication. For example, `emailpass`.

#### Request Body Parameters

This route accepts in the request body an object having the following property:

- `identifier`: The user's identifier in the specified auth provider. For example, for the `emailpass` auth provider, you pass the user's email.

#### Response Fields

If the authentication is successful, the request returns a `201` response code.

### Reset Password Route

The Medusa application defines an API route at `/auth/{actor_type}/{auth_provider}/update` that accepts a token and, if valid, updates the user's password.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/auth/{actor_type}/{providers}/update?token=123
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "email": "Whitney_Schultz@gmail.com",
  "password": "supersecret"
}'
```

<Note>

This API route is useful for providers like `emailpass` that store a user's password and use it for logging them in.

</Note>

#### Path Parameters

Its path parameters are:

- `{actor_type}`: the actor type of the user you're authenticating. For example, `customer`.
- `{provider}`: the auth provider to handle the authentication. For example, `emailpass`.

#### Query Parameters

The route accepts a `token` query parameter, which is the token generated using the [Generate Reset Password Token route](#generate-reset-password-token-route).

### Request Body Parameters

This route accepts in the request body an object that has the data necessary for the provider to update the user's password.

For the `emailpass` provider, you must pass the following properties:

- `email`: The user's email.
- `password`: The new password.

### Response Fields

If the authentication is successful, the request returns an object with a `success` property set to `true`:

```json
