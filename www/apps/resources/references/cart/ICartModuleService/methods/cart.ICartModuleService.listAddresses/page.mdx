# listAddresses - Cart Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listAddresses` method. This belongs to the Cart Module.

This method retrieves a paginated list of addresses based on optional filters and configuration.

## Example

To retrieve a list of addresses using their IDs:

```ts
const addresses = await cartModuleService.listAddresses({
  id: ["caaddr_123", "caaddr_321"],
})
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
const addresses = await cartModuleService.listAddresses(
  {
    id: ["caaddr_123", "caaddr_321"],
  },
  {
    take: 20,
    skip: 2,
  }
)
```
