In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn what a module link is.

## What is a Module Link?

Since modules are isolated, you can't access another module's data models to add a relation to it or extend it.

Instead, you use a module link. A module link forms an association between two data models of different modules, while maintaining module isolation.

## How to Define a Module Link?

### 1. Create Link File

Links are defined in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under the `src/links` directory. The file defines the link using the `defineLink` function imported from `@medusajs/framework/utils` and exports it.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["6", "linkable", "Special `linkable` property that holds the linkable data models of `HelloModule`."],
  ["7", "linkable", "Special `linkable` property that holds the linkable data models of `ProductModule`."],
]

```ts title="src/links/hello-product.ts" highlights={highlights}
import HelloModule from "../modules/hello"
import ProductModule from "@medusajs/medusa/product"
import { defineLink } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export default defineLink(
  ProductModule.linkable.product,
  HelloModule.linkable.myCustom
)
```

The `defineLink` function accepts as parameters the link configurations of each module's data model. A module has a special `linkable` property that holds these configurations for its data models.

In this example, you define a module link between the `hello` module's `MyCustom` data model and the Product Module's `Product` data model.

### 2. Sync Links

After defining the link, run the `db:sync-links` command:

```bash
npx medusa db:sync-links
```

The Medusa application creates a new table for your link to store the IDs of linked records.

Use this command whenever you make changes to your links. For example, run this command if you remove your link definition file.

<Note title="Tip">

You can also use the `db:migrate` command, which both runs the migrations and syncs the links.

</Note>

## How Module Links Work?

When you define a module link, the Medusa application creates a table in the database for that link.

Then, when you create links between records of the data models, the IDs of these data models are stored as a new record in the link's table.

## When to Use Module Links

<Note title="Use module links when" type="success">

- You want to create a relation between data models from different modules.
- You want to extend the data model of another module.

</Note>

<Note title="Don't use module links if" type="error">

You want to create a relationship between data models in the same module. Use data model relationships instead.

</Note>

---

## Define a List Link

By default, the defined link establishes a one-to-one relation: a record of a data model is linked to one record of the other data model.

To specify that a data model can have multiple of its records linked to the other data model's record, use the `isList` option.

For example:

```ts
import HelloModule from "../modules/hello"
import ProductModule from "@medusajs/medusa/product"
import { defineLink } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export default defineLink(
  ProductModule.linkable.product,
  {
    linkable: HelloModule.linkable.myCustom,
    isList: true,
  }
)
```

In this case, you pass an object of configuration as a parameter instead. The object accepts the following properties:

- `linkable`: The data model's link configuration.
- `isList`: Whether multiple records can be linked to one record of the other data model.

In this example, a record of `product` can be linked to more than one record of `myCustom`.

## Set Delete Cascades on Link

To enable delete cascade on a link so that when a record is deleted, its linked records are also deleted, pass the `deleteCascades` property in the object passed to `defineLink`.

For example:

```ts
import HelloModule from "../modules/hello"
import ProductModule from "@medusajs/medusa/product"
import { defineLink } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export default defineLink(
  ProductModule.linkable.product,
  {
    linkable: HelloModule.linkable.myCustom,
    deleteCascades: true,
  }
)
```

In this example, when a product is deleted, its linked `myCustom` record is also deleted.
