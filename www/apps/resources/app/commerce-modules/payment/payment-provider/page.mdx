In this document, you’ll learn what a payment module provider is.

## What's a Payment Module Provider?

A payment module provider registers a payment provider that handles payment processing. It can integrate third-party payment providers, such as Stripe.

To authorize a payment amount with a payment provider, a payment session is created and associated with that payment provider. The payment provider is then used to handle the authorization.

After the payment session is authorized, the payment provider is associated with the resulting payment and handles its payment processing, such as to capture or refund payment.

## System Payment Provider

The Payment Module provides a `system` payment provider that acts as a placeholder payment provider. It doesn’t handle payment processing and delegates that to the merchant. It acts similarly to a cash-on-delivery (COD) payment method.

---

## How are Payment Providers Created?

A payment provider is a TypeScript or JavaScript class that extends the `AbstractPaymentProvider` imported from `@medusajs/framework/utils`. It can then be exported as the main service of a module.

Refer to [this guide](/references/payment/provider) on how to create a payment provider for the Payment Module.

## Configure Payment Providers

The Payment Module accepts a `providers` option that allows you to register providers in your application.

Learn more about this option in [this documentation](../module-options/page.mdx#providers).

## PaymentProvider Data Model

When the Medusa application starts and registers the payment providers, it also creates a record of the `PaymentProvider` data model if none exists. This data model is used to reference a payment provider and determine whether it’s installed in the application.
