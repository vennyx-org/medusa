# softDeleteProductOptionValues - Product Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `softDeleteProductOptionValues` method. This belongs to the Product Module.

This method is used to delete options. Unlike the delete method, this method won't completely remove the option. It can still be accessed or retrieved using methods like retrieve if you pass the `withDeleted` property to the `config` object parameter.

The soft-deleted options can be restored using the restore method.

## Example

```ts
await productModuleService.softDeleteProductOptionValues([
  "optval_123",
  "optval_321",
])
```
