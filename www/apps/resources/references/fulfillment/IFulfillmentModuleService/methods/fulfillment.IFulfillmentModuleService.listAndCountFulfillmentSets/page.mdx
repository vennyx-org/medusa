# listAndCountFulfillmentSets - Fulfillment Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listAndCountFulfillmentSets` method. This belongs to the Fulfillment Module.

This method retrieves a paginated list of fulfillment sets along with the total count of available fulfillment sets satisfying the provided filters.

## Example

To retrieve a list of fulfillment sets using their IDs:

```ts
const [fulfillmentSets, count] =
  await fulfillmentModuleService.listAndCountFulfillmentSets({
    id: ["fuset_123", "fuset_321"],
  })
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the fulfillment set:

```ts
const [fulfillmentSets, count] =
  await fulfillmentModuleService.listAndCountFulfillmentSets(
    {
      id: ["fuset_123", "fuset_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["search_zones"],
    }
  )
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
const [fulfillmentSets, count] =
  await fulfillmentModuleService.listAndCountFulfillmentSets(
    {
      id: ["fuset_123", "fuset_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["search_zones"],
      take: 20,
      skip: 2,
    }
  )
```
