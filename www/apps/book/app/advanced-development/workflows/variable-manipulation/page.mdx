# {metadata.title}

In this chapter, you'll learn how to manipulate variables in a workflow using the transform utility.

## Why Variable Manipulation isn't Allowed in Worflows?

Medusa creates an internal representation of the workflow definition you pass to `createWorkflow` to track and store its steps.

At that point, variables in the workflow don't have any values. They only do when you execute the workflow.

So, you can only pass variables as parameters to steps. But, in a workflow, you can't change a variable's value or, if the variable is an array, loop over its items.

Instead, use the transform utility.

## What is the transform Utility?

The `transform` utility function creates a new variable as the result of manipulating other variables.

For example, consider you have two strings as the output of two steps:

```ts
const str1 = step1()
const str2 = step2()
```

To concatinate the strings, you create a new variable `str3` using the `transform` function:

export const highlights = [
  ["14", "str3", "Holds the result returned by `transform`'s second parameter function."],
  ["15", "", "Specify the data to pass as a parameter to the function in the second parameter."],
  ["16", "data", "The data passed in the first parameter of `transform`."],
  ["16", "`${data.str1}${data.str2}`", "Return the concatenated strings."]
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
import { 
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
  transform,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
// step imports...

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world", 
  function (input) {
    const str1 = step1(input)
    const str2 = step2(input)

    const str3 = transform(
      { str1, str2 },
      (data) => `${data.str1}${data.str2}`
    )

    return new WorkflowResponse(str3)
  }
)
```

The `transform` utility function is imported from `@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk`. It accepts two parameters:

1. The first parameter is an object of variables to manipulate. The object is passed as a parameter to `transform`'s second parameter function.
2. The second parameter is the function performing the variable manipulation.

The value returned by the second parameter function is returned by `transform`. So, the `str3` variable holds the concatenated string.

You can use the returned value in the rest of the workflow, either to pass it as an input to other steps or to return it in the workflow's response.

## Example: Looping Over Array

Use `transform` to loop over arrays to create another variable from the array's items.

For example:

```ts collapsibleLines="1-7" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import { 
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
  transform,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
// step imports...

type WorkflowInput = {
  items: {
    id: string
    name: string
  }[]
}

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world", 
  function ({ items }: WorkflowInput) {
    const ids = transform(
      { items },
      (data) => data.items.map((item) => item.id)
    )
    
    doSomethingStep(ids)

    // ...
  }
)
```

This workflow receives an `items` array in its input.

You use the `transform` utility to create an `ids` variable, which is an array of strings holding the `id` of each item in the `items` array.

You then pass the `ids` variable as a parameter to the `doSomethingStep`.
