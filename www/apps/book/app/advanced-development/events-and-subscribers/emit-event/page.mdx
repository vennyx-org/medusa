In this chapter, you'll learn how to emit an event in a workflow.

## Emit Event Step

Medusa provides an `emitEventStep` helper step in the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package that emits an event.

When you emit an event, you specify the event's name and data payload to pass with the event.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["13", "emitEventStep", "Emit an event."],
  ["14", `"custom.created"`, "The name of the event to emit."],
  ["15", "data", "The data payload to pass with the event."]
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
import { 
  createWorkflow,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import {
  emitEventStep,
} from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

const helloWorldWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world",
  () => {
    // ...

    emitEventStep({
      eventName: "custom.created",
      data: {
        id: "123",
      },
    })
  }
)
```

In this example, you emit the event `custom.created` and pass in the data payload an ID property.

If you execute the workflow, the emit is emitted and any subscribers listening to the event are executed.
