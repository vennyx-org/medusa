Because of how Medusa packages are bundled and released, importing from the `/dist` sub-path of its packages is not allowed.

For example, this is not allowed:

```ts
import { 
  AdminGetApiKeysParams
} from "@medusajs/medusa/dist/api/admin/api-keys" // <-- Not allowed
```

## Importing from Exposed Directories

The `@medusajs/medusa` package allows you to import from the following sub-directories:

- `api`
- `subscribers`
- `jobs`
- `core-flows`
- `loaders`
- `commands`

So, you can still import `AdminGetApiKeysParams` from the example above, however, the import path shouldn't include `/dist`.

So, this is allowed:

```ts
import { 
  AdminGetApiKeysParams
} from "@medusajs/medusa/api/admin/api-keys" // <-- Allowed
```
