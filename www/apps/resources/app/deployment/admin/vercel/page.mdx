In this document, you’ll learn how to deploy the Medusa Admin to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

<Note title="Important">

As Medusa v2 is still in active development, it's highly recommended not to deploy it for production purposes. The deployment process may also change.

</Note>

## 1. Configure Admin in Medusa

In `medusa-config.js`, set the following admin configuration:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    disable: process.env.DISABLE_MEDUSA_ADMIN === "true",
    backendUrl: process.env.MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL,
    path: process.env.MEDUSA_ADMIN_PATH,
  },
})
```

Where:

- You set `disable` to the environment variable `DISABLE_MEDUSA_ADMIN`. In the deployed Medusa application, you set the environment variable’s value to `true` to disable the admin, and when deploying the admin you set it to `false`.
- `backendUrl` will be the URL of the deployed Medusa backend.
- `path` is the base path of the admin, which is `/app` by default. When you set the environment variable `MEDUSA_ADMIN_PATH` later while deploying the admin, you’ll set it to `/`.

## 2. Add Vercel Rewrite

Create the file `vercel.json` in the root directory of your Medusa application with the following content:

```json title="vercel.json"
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

---

## 3. Create Vercel Project

<Note>

Push all changes you’ve made in the previous step to the GitHub repository before proceeding.

</Note>

To create a Vercel project, on your Vercel dashboard:

1. Click on the Add New button at the top right.
2. Choose Project from dropdown.
3. In the list of GitHub repository shown, find the GitHub repository and click its Import button.
4. This shows a form to configure the project:
    1. Choose Other for the Framework Preset field.
    2. Keep the root directory to `.`
    3. Expand the Build and Output Settings section:
        - Set the Build Command field to the following:
        
        ```bash npm2yarn
        npm run build
        ```
        
        - Set the Output Directory field to `build`.
        - Set the Install Command field to the following:
        
        ```bash npm2yarn
        npm install
        ```

    4. Expand the Environment Variables section and add the following variables:
    
    ```bash
    DISABLE_MEDUSA_ADMIN=false
    MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL = # URL of deployed Medusa application
    MEDUSA_ADMIN_PATH=/
    ```
    

Where the value of `MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL` is the URL to your deployed Medusa application.

Then, click the Deploy button to deploy the admin. This takes a couple of minutes. Once the deployment is done, click the Continue to Dashboard button.

## 4. Set Admin URL

Vercel generates a random domain name for your project. You can use it or [set a custom domain name](https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-add-a-custom-domain-to-my-vercel-project).

Once you have the admin’s domain name, you must set the `ADMIN_CORS` environment variable in the Medusa application to the admin’s URL:

```bash
ADMIN_CORS=https://admin-...
```

And add the admin URL to the `AUTH_CORS` environment variable in the Medusa application:

```bash
AUTH_CORS=<OTHER_URLS>,https://admin-...
```

Where `<OTHER_URLS>` are URLs added previously to `AUTH_CORS`, such as the URL of a storefront. URLs in `AUTH_CORS` are separated by a comma.

Then, redeploy the Medusa application.

---

## Test the Admin

To test the admin, open its URL and login with an admin user’s credentials.

<Note>

If you don’t have an admin user on your Medusa application, use the [user command of the Medusa CLI tool](../../../medusa-cli/page.mdx#user).

</Note>

## Troubleshooting

If you’re running into issues in your admin, find the logs in your Vercel project’s dashboard under the Logs tab.
