      description: |
        This API route is used by your storefront or frontend application when a third-party provider redirects to it after authentication. 

        It validates the authentication with the third-party provider and, if successful, returns an authentication token.

        You can decode the JWT token using libraries like [react-jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jwt) in the storefront. If the decoded data doesn't  have an `actor_id` property, then you must register the customer using the Create Customer API route passing the token in the request's Authorization header.
