<Note title="Example Chapter">

This chapter covers how to show the brand of a product in the Medusa Admin using a widget as a step of the ["Customize Admin" chapter](../page.mdx).

## Widget to Show Brand in Product Details

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      text: "Retrieve Brand of Product API Route",
      link: "/customization/extend-models/query-linked-records"
    }
  ]}
/>

To create a widget that shows a product's brand in its details page, create the file `src/admin/widgets/product-brand.tsx` with the following content:

export const highlights = [
  ["7", "data", "Receive the product's details as a prop"],
  ["9", "brand", "A state variable to store the brand"],
  ["19", "fetch", "Retrieve the brand of a product using the custom API route"],
  ["39", "zone", "Show the widget at the top of the product details page."]
]

```tsx title="src/admin/widgets/product-brand.tsx" highlights={highlights}
import { defineWidgetConfig } from "@medusajs/admin-sdk"
import { DetailWidgetProps, AdminProduct } from "@medusajs/types"
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"
import { Container, Heading } from "@medusajs/ui"

const ProductBrandWidget = ({ 
  data,
}: DetailWidgetProps<AdminProduct>) => {
  const [brand, setBrand] = useState<
    Record<string, string> | undefined
  >()
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!loading) {
      return
    }

    fetch(`/admin/products/${data.id}/brand`, {
      credentials: "include",
    })
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then(({ brand }) => {
      setBrand(brand)
      setLoading(false)
    })
  }, [loading])
  
  return (
    <Container>
      <Heading level="h2">Brand</Heading>
      {loading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {brand && <span>Name: {brand.name}</span>}
    </Container>
  )
}

export const config = defineWidgetConfig({
  zone: "product.details.before",
})

export default ProductBrandWidget
```

This adds a widget at the top of the product's details page. 

<Note>

Learn more about widgets [in this guide](../../../basics/admin-customizations/page.mdx).

</Note>

Widgets created in a details page receive the targetted item in a `data` prop. So, the `ProductBrandWidget` receives the product's details in the `data` prop.

In the widget, you fetch the product's brand from the `/admin/products/:id/brand` API route and display it.

<Note>

Admin customizations can use the [Medusa UI package](!ui!) to align your customizations with the admin's design.

## Test it Out

Start your Medusa application and go to a product's details page in the Medusa Admin, you'll find a new block at the top of the page showing the product's brand.

## Next Chapter: Add List of Brands Page

In the next chapter, you'll add a new page or UI route that displays the list of brands in your application.
