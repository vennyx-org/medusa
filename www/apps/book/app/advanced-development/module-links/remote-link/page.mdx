In this chapter, you’ll learn what the remote link is and how to use it to manage links.

## What is the Remote Link?

The remote link is a class with utility methods to manage links between data models. It’s registered in the Medusa container under the `remoteLink` registration name.

For example:

```ts collapsibleLines="1-9" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import { 
  MedusaRequest, 
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { 
  ContainerRegistrationKeys,
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import { 
  RemoteLink,
} from "@medusajs/framework/modules-sdk"

export async function POST(
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
): Promise<void> {
  const remoteLink: RemoteLink = req.scope.resolve(
    ContainerRegistrationKeys.REMOTE_LINK
  )
    
  // ...
}
```

You can use its methods to manage links, such as create or delete links.

## Create Link

To create a link between records of two data models, use the `create` method of the remote link.

For example:

```ts
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

// ...

await remoteLink.create({
  [Modules.PRODUCT]: {
    product_id: "prod_123",
  },
  "helloModuleService": {
    my_custom_id: "mc_123",
  },
})
```

The `create` method accepts as a parameter an object. The object’s keys are the names of the linked modules.

<Note title="Important">

The keys (names of linked modules) must be in the same direction of the link definition.

</Note>

The value of each module’s property is an object, whose keys are of the format `{data_model_snake_name}_id`, and values are the IDs of the linked record.

So, in the example above, you link a record of the `MyCustom` data model in a `hello` module to a `Product` record in the Product Module.

---

## Dismiss Link

To remove a link between records of two data models, use the `dismiss` method of the remote link.

For example:

```ts
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

// ...

await remoteLink.dismiss({
  [Modules.PRODUCT]: {
    product_id: "prod_123",
  },
  "helloModuleService": {
    my_custom_id: "mc_123",
  },
})
```

The `dismiss` method accepts the same parameter type as the [create method](#create-link).

<Note title="Important">

The keys (names of linked modules) must be in the same direction of the link definition.

</Note>

---

## Cascade Delete Linked Records

If a record is deleted, use the `delete` method of the remote link to delete all linked records.

For example:

```ts
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

// ...

await productModuleService.deleteVariants([variant.id])

await remoteLink.delete({
  [Modules.PRODUCT]: {
    product_id: "prod_123",
  },
})
```

This deletes all records linked to the deleted product.

---

## Restore Linked Records

If a record that was previously soft-deleted is now restored, use the `restore` method of the remote link to restore all linked records.

For example:

```ts
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

// ...

await productModuleService.restoreProducts(["prod_123"])

await remoteLink.restore({
  [Modules.PRODUCT]: {
    product_id: "prod_123",
  },
})
```
