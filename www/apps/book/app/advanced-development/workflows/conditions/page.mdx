# {metadata.title}

In this chapter, you'll learn how to execute an action based on a condition in a workflow using the when-then utility.

## Why If-Conditions Aren't Allowed in Workflows?

Medusa creates an internal representation of the workflow definition you pass to `createWorkflow` to track and store its steps.

At that point, variables in the workflow don't have any values. They only do when you execute the workflow.

So, you can't use an if-condition that checks a variable's value, as the condition will be evaluated when Medusa creates the internal representation of the workflow, rather than during execution.

Instead, use the when-then utility.

---

## What is the When-Then Utility?

The when-then utility functions execute an action if a condition is satisfied.

The `when` function accepts as a parameter a function that returns a boolean value, and the `then` function is chained to `when`. `then` accepts as a parameter a function that's executed if `when`'s parameter function returns a `true` value.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["15", "input", "The data to pass as a parameter to the function in the second parameter"],
  ["17", "return", "The function must return a boolean value indicating whether\nthe callback function passed to `then` should be executed."],
  ["19", "() => {", "The function to execute if `when`'s second parameter returns a `true` value."]
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
import { 
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
  when,
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"
// step imports...

const workflow = createWorkflow(
  "workflow", 
  function (input: {
    is_active: boolean
  }) {

    const result = when(
      input, 
      (input) => {
        return input.is_active
      }
    ).then(() => {
      const stepResult = isActiveStep()
      return stepResult
    })

    // executed without condition
    const anotherStepResult = anotherStep(result)

    return new WorkflowResponse(
      anotherStepResult
    )
  }
)
```

In this code snippet, you execute the `isActiveStep` only if the `input.is_active`'s value is `true`.

### When Parameters

`when` utility is a function imported from `@medusajs/workflows-sdk`. It accepts the following parameters:

1. The first parameter is either an object or the workflow's input. This data is passed as a parameter to the function in `when`'s second parameter.
2. The second parameter is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether to execute the action in `then`.

### Then Parameters

To specify the action to perform if the condition is satisfied, chain a `then` function to `when` and pass it a callback function.

The callback function is only executed if `when`'s second parameter function returns a `true` value.
