In this chapter, you'll learn how to send a response in your API route.

## Send a JSON Response

To send a JSON response, use the `json` method of the `MedusaResponse` object passed as the second parameter of your API route handler.

For example:

export const jsonHighlights = [
  ["7", "json", "Return a JSON object."]
]

```ts title="src/api/custom/route.ts" highlights={jsonHighlights}
import { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from "@medusajs/framework/http"

export const GET = async (
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) => {
  res.json({
    message: "Hello, World!",
  })
}
```

This API route returns the following JSON object:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, World!"
}
```

## Set Response Status Code

By default, setting the JSON data using the `json` method returns a response with a `200` status code.

To change the status code, use the `status` method of the `MedusaResponse` object.

For example:

export const statusHighlight = [
  ["7", "status", "Set the response code to `201`."]
]

```ts title="src/api/custom/route.ts" highlights={statusHighlight}
import { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from "@medusajs/framework/http"

export const GET = async (
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) => {
  res.status(201).json({
    message: "Hello, World!",
  })
}
```

The response of this API route has the status code `201`.

## Change Response Content Type

To return response data other than a JSON object, use the `writeHead` method of the `MedusaResponse` object. It allows you to set the response headers, including the content type.

For example, to create an API route that returns an event stream:

export const streamHighlights = [
  ["7", "writeHead", "Set the response's headers."],
  ["7", "200", "Set the status code."],
  ["8", `"Content-Type"`, "Set the response's content type."],
  ["13", "interval", "Simulate stream data using an interval"],
  ["14", "write", "Write stream data."],
  ["17", "on", "Stop the stream when the request is terminated."]
]

```ts highlights={streamHighlights}
import { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from "@medusajs/framework/http"

export const GET = async (
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {
    "Content-Type": "text/event-stream",
    "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
    Connection: "keep-alive",
  })

  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    res.write("Streaming data...\n")
  }, 3000)

  req.on("end", () => {
    clearInterval(interval)
    res.end()
  })
}
```

The `writeHead` method accepts two parameters:

1. The first one is the response's status code.
2. The second is an object of key-value pairs to set the headers of the response.

This API route opens a stream by setting the `Content-Type` in the header to `text/event-stream`. It then simulates a stream by creating an interval that writes the stream data every three seconds.

## Do More with Responses

The `MedusaResponse` type is based on [Express's Response](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res). Refer to their API reference for other uses of responses.
