In this chapter, you'll learn how to integrate a third-party system into Medusa.

## How to Integrate a Third-Party System?

To integrate a third-party system into Medusa, you:

1. Implement the methods to interact with the system in a service. It can either be the main module's service, or an internal service in the module that's used by the main one.
2. Implement in workflows custom features around the integration, such as sending data to the third-party system.
    - Workflows roll-back mechanism ensures data consistency. This is essential as you integrate multiple systems into your application.
3. Use the workflow in other resources to expose or utilize the custom functionality.

## Next Chapters: Syncing Brands Example

In the next chapters, you'll implement an example of syncing brands with a third-party system, such as a Content Management System (CMS).

That requires:

1. Implementing the service that integrates the third-party system.
2. Creating a brand in the third-party system when a brand is created in Medusa.
2. Retrieving the brands from the third-party system to sync them with Medusa's brands at a scheduled interval.
