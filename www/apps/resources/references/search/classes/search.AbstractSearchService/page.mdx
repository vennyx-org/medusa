# How to Create a Search Service

In this document, you’ll learn how to create a search service in the Medusa backend and the methods you must implement in it.

## Prerequisites

A search service must extend the `AbstractSearchService` class imported from the `@medusajs/framework/utils` package. If you don’t already have the package 
installed, run the following command to install it within your project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/utils
```

---

## Overview

A search service class is in a TypeScript or JavaScript file created in the `src/services` directory. The class must extend the `AbstractSearchService` class imported
 from the `@medusajs/utils` package.

Based on services’ naming conventions, the file’s name should be the slug version of the search service’s name without `service`, and the class’s name should be the 
pascal case of the search service’s name following by `Service`.

For example, create the `MySearchService` class in the file `src/services/my-search.ts`:

```ts title="src/services/my-search.ts"
import { AbstractSearchService } from "@medusajs/utils"

class MySearchService extends AbstractSearchService {
  isDefault = false
  
  createIndex(indexName: string, options: Record<string, any>) {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
  }
  getIndex(indexName: string) {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
  }
  addDocuments(
    indexName: string,
    documents: Record<string, any>[],
    type: string
  ) {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
  }
  replaceDocuments(
    indexName: string,
    documents: Record<string, any>[],
    type: string
  ) {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
  }
  deleteDocument(
    indexName: string,
    document_id: string | number
  ) {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
  }
  deleteAllDocuments(indexName: string) {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
  }
  search(
    indexName: string,
    query: string, 
    options: Record<string, any>
  ) {
    return {
      message: "test",
    }
  }
  updateSettings(
    indexName: string, 
    settings: Record<string, any>
  ) {
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
  }

}

export default MySearchService
```

## Notes About Class Methods

Although there are several helper methods in this class, the main methods used by the Medusa backend are `addDocuments`, `deleteDocument`, and `search`. 
The rest of the methods are provided in case you need them for custom use cases.

---

## constructor

You can use the `constructor` of your search service to access the different services in Medusa through dependency injection.

You can also use the constructor to initialize your integration with the third-party provider. For example, if you use a client to connect to the third-party provider’s APIs,
you can initialize it in the constructor and use it in other methods in the service.

Additionally, if you’re creating your search service as an external plugin to be installed on any Medusa backend and you want to access the options added for the plugin,
you can access them in the constructor. The default constructor already sets the value of the class proeprty `options_` to the passed options.

### Example

```ts
// ...
import { ProductService } from "@medusajs/medusa"

type InjectedDependencies = {
  productService: ProductService
}

class MySearchService extends AbstractSearchService {
  // ...
  protected readonly productService_: ProductService

  constructor({ productService }: InjectedDependencies) {
    // @ts-expect-error prefer-rest-params
    super(...arguments)
    this.productService_ = productService

    // you can also initialize a client that
    // communicates with a third-party service.
    this.client = new Client(options)
  }

  // ...
}
```

### Parameters

## Properties

<TypeList types={[{"name":"isDefault","type":"`any`","description":"This property is used to pinpoint the default search service defined in the Medusa core. For custom search services, the `isDefault` property must be `false`.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"options_","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","description":"If your search service is created in a plugin, the plugin's options will be available in this property.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/v2/advanced-development/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="AbstractSearchService"/>

## Methods

### createIndex

This method is used to create an index in the search engine.

#### Example

An example implementation, assuming `client` would interact with a third-party service:

```ts title="src/services/my-search.ts"
class MySearchService extends AbstractSearchService {
  // ...
  createIndex(indexName: string, options: Record<string, any>) {
    return this.client_.initIndex(indexName)
  }
  // ...
}
```

Another example of how the [MeiliSearch plugin](https://docs.medusajs.com/plugins/search/meilisearch) uses the
`options` parameter:

```ts
class MeiliSearchService extends AbstractSearchService {
  // ...
  async createIndex(
    indexName: string,
    options: Record<string, unknown> = { primaryKey: "id" }
  ) {
    return await this.client_.createIndex(indexName, options)
  }
  // ...
}
```

  // ...

  async deleteDocument(
    indexName: string,
    document_id: string | number

### deleteAllDocuments

This method is used to delete all documents from an index.

#### Example

```ts
class MySearchService extends AbstractSearchService {
  // ...

  async deleteAllDocuments(indexName: string) {
    return await this.client_
      .deleteDocuments(indexName)
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"indexName","type":"`string`","description":"The index's name.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/v2/advanced-development/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="deleteAllDocuments"/>

### search

This method is used to search through an index by a query.

In the Medusa backend, this method is used within the [Search Products API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#products\_postproductssearch) 
to retrieve the search results. The API route's response type is an array of items, though the item's format is not defined as it depends on the
data returned by this method.

#### Example

```ts
class MySearchService extends AbstractSearchService {
  // ...

  async search(
    indexName: string,
    query: string,
    options: Record<string, any>
  ) {
    const hits = await this.client_
      .search(indexName, query)
    return {
      hits,
    }
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"indexName","type":"`string`","description":"The index's name. In the case of the Search Products API Routes, its value is `products`.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"query","type":"`null` \\| `string`","description":"The search query to retrieve results for.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"options","type":"`unknown`","description":"Options that can configure the search process. The Search Products API route passes an object having the properties:\n\n- `paginationOptions`: An object having an `offset` and `limit` properties, which are passed in the API Route's body.\n- `filter`: Filters that are passed in the API Route's request body. Its format is unknown, so you can pass filters based on your search service.\n- `additionalOptions`: Any other parameters that may be passed in the request's body.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/v2/advanced-development/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="search"/>

#### Returns

<TypeList types={[{"name":"unknown","type":"`unknown`","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"The list of results. For example, an array of products.","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/v2/advanced-development/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="search"/>

### updateSettings

This method is used to update the settings of an index within the search service. This is useful if you want to update the index settings when the plugin options change.

For example, in the Algolia plugin, a loader, which runs when the Medusa backend loads, is used to update the settings of indices based on the plugin options. 
The loader uses this method to update the settings.

#### Example

```ts
class MySearchService extends AbstractSearchService {
  // ...

  async updateSettings(
    indexName: string,
    settings: Record<string, any>
  ) {
    return await this.client_
      .updateSettings(indexName, settings)
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"indexName","type":"`string`","description":"The index's name to update its settings.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"settings","type":"`unknown`","description":"The settings to update. Its format depends on your use case.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/v2/advanced-development/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="updateSettings"/>

#### Returns

<TypeList types={[{"name":"unknown","type":"`unknown`","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"The response of updating the index in the search engine, but there’s no required format of the response.","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/v2/advanced-development/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="updateSettings"/>

## Test Implementation

:::note

If you created your search service in a plugin, refer to [this guide on how to test plugins](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/plugins/create#test-your-plugin).

:::

After finishing your search service implementation:

1\. Make sure you have an [event bus module](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/events/modules/redis) installed that triggers search indexing when the Medusa backend loads.

2\. Run the `build` command in the root of your Medusa backend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
```

3\. Start the backend with the `develop` command:

```bash
npx medusa develop
```

4\. Try to search for products either using the [Search Products API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#products_postproductssearch). The results returned by your search service's `search` method is returned in the `hits` response field.
