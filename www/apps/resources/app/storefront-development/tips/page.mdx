## Connect to the Medusa Application

<Note type="soon">

Support for Medusa v2 in Medusa React and the JS Client is coming soon.

</Note>

To send requests from the storefront to the Medusa application’s Store API Routes, you have three options:

- **For other frontend technologies**: interact directly with the Medusa application by sending requests to its [Store REST APIs](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store).
- **For React-based storefronts**: use Medusa React. It provides you with the necessary hooks to retrieve or manipulate data from your Medusa application.
- **For JavaScript frameworks**: use Medusa’s JavaScript Client in any JavaScript framework. This NPM package facilitates interacting with the backend’s REST APIs.

## Install Types Package

The `@medusajs/types` package provide API routes' request and response types.

If you're not using the JS Client or Medusa React, install `@medusajs/types` to use the correct request and response types:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/types@rc
```

## Configure CORS

The Medusa application’s API routes are guarded by a CORS middleware. Make sure to set the `storeCors` property of the `http` configuration in `medusa-config.js` to the storefront’s URL.

For example:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    http: {
      storeCors: "http://localhost:3000",
      // ...
    },
  },
  // ...
})
```
