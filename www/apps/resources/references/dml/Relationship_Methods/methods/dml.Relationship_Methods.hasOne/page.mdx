# hasOne Relationship Method - API Reference

This method defines a relationship between two data models,
where the owner of the relationship has one record of the related
data model.

For example: A user "hasOne" email.

Use the [belongsTo](../dml.Relationship_Methods.belongsTo/page.mdx) method to define the inverse of this relationship in
the other data model.

## Example

```ts
import { model } from "@medusajs/utils"

const User = model.define("user", {
  id: model.id(),
  email: model.hasOne(() => Email),
})
```
