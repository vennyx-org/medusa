  summary: Validate Authentication Callback
  description: >
    This API route is used by your dashboard or frontend application when a
    third-party provider redirects to it after authentication. 


    It validates the authentication with the third-party provider and, if
    successful, returns an authentication token.


    You can decode the JWT token using libraries like
    [react-jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jwt) in the frontend. If the
    decoded data doesn't  have an `actor_id` property, then you must create a
    user, typically using the Accept Invite route passing the token in the
    request's Authorization header.
