In this chapter, you'll learn about the concepts you need to build custom features in your Medusa application.

To add a custom feature to your application, you create:

1. A module with data models and a main service to manage them.
2. A workflow to create, update, and delete records of data models. You implement functionalities in a workflow to benefit from features such as roll-back in case of errors, retry configurations, and more.
3. An API route that exposes the workflow's functionality to clients, such as the storefront or admin dashboard.
