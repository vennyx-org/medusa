<Note title="Example Chapter">

This chapter covers how to define a workflow that creates a brand as part of the ["Build Custom Features" chapter](../page.mdx).

</Note>

## Workflows vs Services: Why use Workflows?

When manipulating data, use workflows instead of invoking a service's methods directly in your API route or other customizations.

Workflows eliminate data inconsistency in your application with its compensation mechanism that undoes changes if an error occurs. For example, if a workflow's step creates a brand, it also defines a compensation mechanism to remove the brand if an error occurs.

<Note>

Learn more about workflows [in this guide](../../../basics/workflows/page.mdx).

</Note>

This is even more useful when you create workflows with many steps, or integrate third-party systems.

## Create createBrandWorkflow

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      text: "Brand Module",
      link: "/customization/custom-features/module"
    }
  ]}
/>

Create the file `src/workflows/create-brand/index.ts` with the following content:

```ts
import {
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"

export type CreateBrandInput = {
  name: string
}

export const createBrandWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "create-brand",
  (input: CreateBrandInput) => {
    // TODO
  }
)
```

For now, this workflow only defines its input. You'll create its step and use it in the workflow.

---

## Create createBrandStep

Create the file `src/workflows/create-brand/steps/create-brand.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/workflows/create-brand/steps/create-brand.ts" collapsibleLines="1-8" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import {
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"
import { CreateBrandInput } from ".."
import { BRAND_MODULE } from "../../../modules/brand"
import BrandModuleService from "../../../modules/brand/service"

export const createBrandStep = createStep(
  "create-brand-step",
  async (input: CreateBrandInput, { container }) => {
    const brandModuleService: BrandModuleService = container.resolve(
      BRAND_MODULE
    )

    const brand = await brandModuleService.createBrands(input)

    return new StepResponse(brand, brand.id)
  }
)
```

This defines a `createBrandStep`. In the step, you resolve the Brand Module's main service and use its generated `createBrands` method, which accepts one or more objects of brands to create.

The step returns the created brand in the first parameter of the `StepResponse`'s constructor.

### Add Compensation Function to Step

A compensation function rolls back changes made by the step if an error occurs in the workflow.

The second parameter of the `StepResponse`'s constructor is passed to the compensation function.

To add the compensation function, pass a third parameter to `createStep`:

```ts title="src/workflows/create-brand/steps/create-brand.ts"
export const createBrandStep = createStep(
  // ...
  async (id: string, { container }) => {
    const brandModuleService: BrandModuleService = container.resolve(
      BRAND_MODULE
    )

    await brandModuleService.deleteBrands(id)
  }
)
```

You resolve the Brand Module's main service and use its generated `deleteBrands` method to delete the brand created by the step.

<Note title="Tip">

The `deleteBrands` method accepts an ID or an array of IDs of brands to delete.

</Note>

So, when an error occurs during the workflow, the brand that was created by the step is deleted to maintain data consistency.

---

## Add Step to Workflow

Go back to the workflow at `src/workflows/create-brand/index.ts` and import the step you created:

```ts
import { createBrandStep } from "./steps/create-brand"
```

Then, replace the `TODO` with the following:

```ts
const brand = createBrandStep(input)

return new WorkflowResponse(brand)
```

You use the `createBrandStep` to create the brand and return it in the workflow's response.

---

## Next Step: Create Brand API Route

In the next step, you'll create an API route that allows admin users to create a brand using this workflow.
