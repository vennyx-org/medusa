<Note title="Example Chapter">

This chapter covers how to retrieve the brand linked to a product using Query as a step of the ["Extend Models" chapter](../page.mdx).

</Note>

## What is Query?

Query is a utility that retrieves data across modules and their links. Itâ€™s registered in the Medusa container under the `ContainerRegistrationKeys.QUERY` (`query`) registration name.

## Retrieve Brand of Product API Route

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      text: "Brand Module",
      link: "/customization/custom-features/module"
    },
    {
      text: "Defined link between the Brand and Product data models.",
      link: "/customization/extend-models/define-link"
    }
  ]}
/>

You'll create an API route that retrieves the brand of a product. You'll use this in a later chapter.

Create the file `src/api/admin/products/[id]/brand/route.ts` with the following content:

export const highlights = [
  ["13", "resolve", "Resolve Query from the Medusa Container."],
  ["17", "graph", "Run a query to retrieve a product by its ID and its brand."],
  ["18", "entity", "The name of the model to query."],
  ["19", "fields", "The fields and relations to retrieve."],
  ["20", "filters", "The filters to apply on the retrieved data."]
]

```ts title="src/api/admin/products/[id]/brand/route.ts" highlights={highlights} collapsibleLines="1-8" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import {
  MedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"
import {
  ContainerRegistrationKeys,
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export const GET = async (
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) => {
  const query = req.scope.resolve(
    ContainerRegistrationKeys.QUERY
  )

  const { data: [product] } = await query.graph({
    entity: "product",
    fields: ["brand.*"],
    filters: {
      id: req.params.id,
    },
  })

  res.json({ brand: product.brand })
}
```

In this example, you retrieve a product by its ID with its brand, and return the brand in the response.

### query.graph Parameters

The `graph` method of Query runs a query to retrieve data. It accepts an object having the following properties:

- `entity`: The data model's name as specified in the first parameter of `model.define`.
- `fields`: An array of properties and relations to retrieve. You can pass:
    - A property's name, such as `id`.
    - A relation or linked model's name, such as `brand`. You suffix the name with `.*` to retrieve all its properties.
- `filters`: An object of filters to apply on the retrieved data model's properties.

<Note>

Filters currently don't work on models of another module, such as `brand` in this example.

</Note>

## Test it Out

To test the API route out, first, retrieve the authentication token of your admin user by sending a `POST` request to `/auth/user/emailpass`:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/auth/user/emailpass' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email": "admin@medusa-test.com",
    "password": "supersecret"
}'
```

Make sure to replace the email and password with your user's credentials.

Then, send a `GET` request to `/admin/products/:id/brand`:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:9000/admin/products/prod_123/brand' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
```

This returns the product's brand if it has one. For example:

```json title="Example Response"
{
  "brand": {
    "id": "123",
    "name": "Acme",
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Retrieve Products of a Brand

An example of retrieving the products of a brand:

export const brandProductsHighlights = [
  ["7", `"products.*"`, "Use the plural name of `product` since a brand has multiple products."]
]

```ts highlights={brandProductsHighlights}
const query = req.scope.resolve(
  ContainerRegistrationKeys.QUERY
)

const { data: [brand] } = await query.graph({
  entity: "brand",
  fields: ["products.*"],
  filters: {
    id: req.params.id,
  },
})
```

In this case, since a brand has multiple products, you specify the plural name of the `Product` data model (`products`) in `fields`.

The retrieved `brand` now has a `products` field, which is an array of products linked to it:

```json title="Example Response"
{
  "brand": {
    "products": [
      // ...
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Summary

By following the examples of the previous chapters, you:

- Defined a link between the Brand and Product modules's data models, as if you're extending the `Product` model to add a brand.
- Created a link between brand and product records.
- Queried the brand linked to a product, and vice versa.

## Next Steps

In the next chapters, you'll learn how to customize the Medusa Admin to show brands.
