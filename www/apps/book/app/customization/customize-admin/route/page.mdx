<Note title="Example Chapter">

This chapter covers how to create a UI route (or page) that shows your brands as a step of the ["Customize Admin" chapter](../page.mdx).

</Note>

## What is a UI Route?

A UI route is a React Component that adds a new page to your admin dashboard.

The UI Route can be shown in the sidebar or added as a nested page.

## Prerequisite: Add Retrieve Brand API Route

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      text: "Brand Module",
      link: "/customization/custom-features/module"
    },
  ]}
/>

Before adding the UI route, you need an API route that retrieves all brands.

Create the file `src/api/admin/brands/route.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/api/admin/brands/route.ts" collapsibleLines="1-7" expandMoreButton="Show Imports"
import {
  MedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { BRAND_MODULE } from "../../../modules/brand"
import BrandModuleService from "../../../modules/brand/service"

export const GET = async (
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) => {
  const brandModuleService: BrandModuleService = req.scope.resolve(
    BRAND_MODULE
  )

  const limit = req.query.limit || 15
  const offset = req.query.offset || 0

  const [brands, count] = await brandModuleService.listAndCountBrands({}, {
    skip: offset as number,
    take: limit as number,
  })

  res.json({
    brands,
    count,
    limit,
    offset,
  })
}
```

This adds a `GET` API route at `/admin/brands`.

In the API route, you resolve the Brand Module's main service and use its `listAndCountBrands` method to retrieve the list of brands with their total count.

This method accepts as a first parameter filters to apply on the retrieved data, and as a second parameter configurations for pagination. 

<Note>

Learn more about the `listAndCount` method and its parameters in [this reference](!resources!service-factory-reference/methods/listAndCount).

## Add a UI Route to Show Brands

A UI route is created in a file named `page.tsx` under subdirectories of the `src/admin/routes` directory. The file’s default export must be the UI route’s React component.

To create a UI route that shows the list of brands, create the file `src/admin/routes/brands/page.tsx` with the following content:

export const uiRouteHighlights = [
  ["7", "brands", "State variable to store the brands."],
  ["12", "fetch", "Retrieve the brands from the custom API route."]
]

```tsx title="src/admin/routes/brands/page.tsx" highlights={uiRouteHighlights}
import { Table, Container, Heading } from "@medusajs/ui"
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"
import { defineRouteConfig } from "@medusajs/admin-sdk"
import { TagSolid } from "@medusajs/icons"

const BrandsPage = () => {
  const [brands, setBrands] = useState<
    Record<string, string>[]
  >([])
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`/admin/brands`, {
      credentials: "include",
    })
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then(({ brands: brandsData }) => {
      setBrands(brandsData)
    })
  }, [])


  return (
    <Container>
      <Heading level="h2">Brands</Heading>
      <Table>
        <Table.Header>
          <Table.Row>
            <Table.HeaderCell>ID</Table.HeaderCell>
            <Table.HeaderCell>Name</Table.HeaderCell>
          </Table.Row>
        </Table.Header>
        <Table.Body>
          {brands.map((brand) => (
            <Table.Row key={brand.id}>
              <Table.Cell>{brand.id}</Table.Cell>
              <Table.Cell>{brand.name}</Table.Cell>
            </Table.Row>
          ))}
        </Table.Body>
      </Table>
    </Container>
  )
}

export default BrandsPage

// TODO export configuration
```

This adds a new page in the admin at `http://localhost:9000/app/brands`.

In the UI route's component, you retrieve the brands from the `/admin/brands` API route. You show the brands in a table.

### Add UI Route to the Sidebar

To add the UI route to the sidebar, replace the `TODO` at the end of the file with the following:

```ts title="src/admin/routes/brands/page.tsx"
export const config = defineRouteConfig({
  label: "Brands",
  icon: TagSolid,
})
```

You export a `config` variable defined using the `defineRouteConfig` utility.

This indicates that a new item should be added to the sidebar with the title `Brands` and an icon from the [Medusa Icons package](!ui!/icons/overview).

---

## Test it Out

To test it out, start the Medusa application and login into the Medusa Admin.

You'll find a new "Brands" sidebar item. If you click on it, a new page opens showing the list of brands in your store.

---

## Summary

By following the examples of the previous chapters, you:

- Created a widget that showed the brand of a product in the Medusa Admin.
- Created a UI route that showed the list of brands in the Medusa Admin.

## Next Steps

In the next chapters, you'll learn how to integrate third-party systems into your Medusa application to sync brands.
