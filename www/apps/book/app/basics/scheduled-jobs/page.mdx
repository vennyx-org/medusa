In this chapter, you’ll learn about scheduled jobs and how to use them.

## What is a Scheduled Job?

A scheduled job is a function executed at a specified interval of time in the background of your Medusa application. It’s like a cron job that runs during the application's runtime.

For example, you can synchronize your inventory with an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system once a day using a scheduled job.

## How to Create a Scheduled Job?

A scheduled job is created in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under the `src/jobs` directory.

For example, create the file `src/jobs/hello-world.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/jobs/hello-world.ts"
// the scheduled-job function
export default function () {
  console.log("Time to say hello world!")
}

// the job's configurations
export const config = {
  name: "every-minute-message",
  // execute every minute
  schedule: "* * * * *",
}

```

A scheduled job file must export:

- A function to be executed whenever it’s time to run the scheduled job.
- A configuration object defining the job. It has two properties:
    - `name`: a unique name for the job.
    - `schedule`: a [cron expression](https://crontab.guru/) specifying when to run the job.

This scheduled job executes every minute and logs into the terminal `Time to say hello world!`.

### Test Scheduled Jobs

To test out your scheduled job, start the Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

After a minute, the following message will be logged to the terminal:

```bash
Time to say hello world!
```

## When to Use Scheduled Jobs

<Note title="Use scheduled jobs when" type="success">

- You're executing an action at a specified time interval during application runtime.
- The action must be executed automatically.

</Note>

<Note title="Don't use scheduled jobs if" type="error">

- You want the action to execute at a specified time interval while the Medusa application **isn't** running. Instead, use the operating system's equivalent of a cron job.
- You want to execute the action once. Use loaders instead.
- You want to execute the action if an event occurs. Use subscribers instead.

</Note>

## Resolve Resources

The scheduled job function receives a `container` parameter, which is the Medusa container. Use it to resolve resources in your Medusa application, such as services.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["11", "resolve", "Resolve the Product Module's main service."],
  ["11", "Modules.PRODUCT", "The module's registration name imported from `@medusajs/utils`."]
]

```ts title="src/jobs/hello-world.ts" highlights={highlights}
import {
  IProductModuleService,
  MedusaContainer,
} from "@medusajs/types"
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/utils"

export default async function myCustomJob(
  container: MedusaContainer
) {
  const productModuleService: IProductModuleService = 
    container.resolve(Modules.PRODUCT)

  const [, count] = await productModuleService.listAndCountProducts()

  console.log(
    `Time to check products! You have ${count} product(s)`
  )
}

export const config = {
  name: "every-minute-message",
  // execute every minute
  schedule: "* * * * *",
}
```

In the scheduled job function, you resolve the Product Module's main service and retrieve the number of products in the store, then log the number in the terminal.
