# listOrderShippingMethodAdjustments - Order Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listOrderShippingMethodAdjustments` method. This belongs to the Order Module.

This method retrieves a paginated list of shipping method adjustments based on optional filters and configuration.

## Example

To retrieve a list of shipping method adjustments using their IDs:

```ts
const shippingMethodAdjustments = await orderModuleService
  .listOrderShippingMethodAdjustments({
    id: ["123", "321"]
  })
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the shipping method adjustment:

```ts
const shippingMethodAdjustments = await orderModuleService
  .listOrderShippingMethodAdjustments({
    id: ["123", "321"]
  }, {
    relations: ["shipping_method"]
  })
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
const shippingMethodAdjustments = await orderModuleService
  .listOrderShippingMethodAdjustments({
    id: ["123", "321"]
  }, {
    relations: ["shipping_method"],
    take: 20,
    skip: 2
  })
```
