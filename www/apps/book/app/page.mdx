# {pageNumber} Introduction

Medusa is a digital commerce platform with a built-in framework for customizations and integrations.

Medusa's framework includes two types of tools:

1. Modules that provide commerce functionalities, such as Product, Order, and Cart modules.
2. Customization tools to build your business features, such as custom data models, business logic, flows, and endpoints.

With these tools, you save time you would spend with other platforms on maintaining and setting up your customizations. Instead, you rapidly build important features for your business.

## Who is Medusa for

Medusa is for ambitious businesses and developers that are limited by traditional ecommerce solutions:

- You want rich commerce features that are customizable and flexible enough to support your business use case as if you built them from scratch.
- You want your custom requirements built as an integral part of the commerce application’s features and architecture, rather than hacked into it.
- You want to customize your commerce flows by integrating external services without data inconsistency and irregularity.
