<Note title="Example Chapter">

This chapter covers how to create a link between the records of the `Brand` and `Product` data models as a step of the ["Extend Models" chapter](../page.mdx).

</Note>

## What is the Remote Link?

The remote link is a class with utility methods to manage links between data models' records.

Itâ€™s registered in the Medusa container under the `ContainerRegistrationKeys.REMOTE_LINK` (`remoteLink`) registration name.

### Example: Create Link with Remote Link

For example, consider the following step:

export const stepHighlights = [
  ["19", "resolve", "Resolve the remote link."],
  ["23", "create", "Create a link between two records."]
]

```ts highlights={stepHighlights} collapsibleLines="1-10" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import { 
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
} from "@medusajs/workflows-sdk"
import { 
  Modules,
  ContainerRegistrationKeys,
} from "@medusajs/utils"
import { BRAND_MODULE } from "../../modules/brand"

type LinkProductToBrandStepInput = {
  productId: string
  brandId: string
}

export const linkProductToBrandStep = createStep(
  "link-product-to-brand",
  async ({ productId, brandId }: LinkProductToBrandStepInput, { container }) => {
    const remoteLink = container.resolve(
      ContainerRegistrationKeys.REMOTE_LINK
    )

    remoteLink.create({
      [Modules.PRODUCT]: {
        product_id: productId,
      },
      [BRAND_MODULE]: {
        brand_id: brandId,
      },
    })

    return new StepResponse(undefined, {
      productId,
      brandId,
    })
  }
)
```

In this step, you resolve the remote link, then use its `create` method to create a link between product and brand records.

The `create` method accepts as a parameter an object whose properties are the names of each module, and the value is an object.

<Note title="Tip">

Use the `Modules` enum imported from `@medusajs/utils` to for the commerce module's names.

</Note>

The value object has a property, which is the name of the data model (as specified in `model.define`'s first parameter) followed by `_id`, and its value is the ID of the record to link.

### Dismiss Link in Compensation

The above step can have the following compensation function that dismisses the link between the records:

export const compensationHighlights = [
  ["4", "resolve", "Resolve the remote link."],
  ["8", "dismiss", "Create a link between two records."]
]

```ts highlights={compensationHighlights}
export const linkProductToBrandStep = createStep(
  // ...
  async ({ productId, brandId }, { container }) => {
    const remoteLink = container.resolve(
      ContainerRegistrationKeys.REMOTE_LINK
    )

    remoteLink.dismiss({
      [Modules.PRODUCT]: {
        product_id: productId,
      },
      [BRAND_MODULE]: {
        brand_id: brandId,
      },
    })
  }
)
```

The `dismiss` method removes the link to dismiss between two records. Its parameter is the same as that of the `create` method.

## Next Step: Extend Create Product API Route

In the next step, you'll extend the Create Product API route to allow passing a brand ID, and link a product to a brand.
