      The number of units a single quantity is equivalent to. For example, if a
      customer orders one quantity of the variant, Medusa checks the
      availability of the quantity multiplied by the value set for
      `required_quantity`. When the customer orders the quantity, Medusa
      reserves the ordered quantity multiplied by the value set for
      `required_quantity`.
