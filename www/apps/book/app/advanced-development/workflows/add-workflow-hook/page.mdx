In this chapter, you'll learn how to expose a hook in your workflow.

## When to Expose a Hook

<Note title="Expose workflow hooks when" type="success">

Your workflow is reusable in other applications, and you allow performing an external action at some point in your workflow.

</Note>

<Note title="Don't expose workflow hooks if" type="error">

Your workflow isn't reusable by other applications. Use a step that performs what a hook handler would instead.

## How to Expose a Hook in a Workflow?

To expose a hook in your workflow, use the `createHook` function imported from `@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk`.

For example:

export const hookHighlights = [
  ["13", "createHook", "Add a hook to the workflow."],
  ["14", `"productCreated"`, "The hook's name."],
  ["15", "productId", "The data to pass to the hook handler."],
  ["19", "hooks", "Return the list of hooks in the workflow."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/my-workflow/index.ts" highlights={hookHighlights}
import {
  createStep,
  createHook,
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { createProductStep } from "./steps/create-product"

export const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "my-workflow", 
  function (input) {
    const product = createProductStep(input)
    const productCreatedHook = createHook(
      "productCreated", 
      { productId: product.id }
    )

    return new WorkflowResponse(product, {
      hooks: [productCreatedHook],
    })
  }
)
```

The `createHook` function accepts two parameters:

1. The first is a string indicating the hook's name. You use this to consume the hook later.
2. The second is the input to pass to the hook handler.

The workflow must also pass an object having a `hooks` property as a second parameter to the `WorkflowResponse` constructor. Its value is an array of the workflow's hooks.

### How to Consume the Hook?

To consume the hook of the workflow, create the file `src/workflows/hooks/my-workflow.ts` with the following content:

export const handlerHighlights = [
  ["3", "productCreated", "Invoke the hook, passing it a step function as a parameter."],
]

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/my-workflow.ts" highlights={handlerHighlights}
import { myWorkflow } from "../my-workflow"

myWorkflow.hooks.productCreated(
  async ({ productId }, { container }) => {
    // TODO perform an action
  }
)
```

The hook is available on the workflow's `hooks` property using its name `productCreated`.

You invoke the hook, passing a step function (the hook handler) as a parameter.
