<Note title="Example Chapter">

This chapter covers how to integrate a dummy third-party system in a service as a step of the ["Integrate Systems" chapter](../page.mdx).

</Note>

## 1. Create Service

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      text: "Brand Module",
      link: "/customization/custom-features/module"
    }
  ]}
/>

Start by creating the file `src/modules/brand/services/client.ts` with the following content:

export const serviceHighlights = [
  ["4", "BrandClientOptions", "Define the options that the Brand Module receives necessary for the integration."],
  ["8", "InjectedDependencies", "Define the dependencies injected into the service."],
  ["20", "moduleDef", "Retrieve the module's configuration."]
]

```ts title="src/modules/brand/services/client.ts" highlights={serviceHighlights}
import { Logger, ConfigModule } from "@medusajs/types"
import { BRAND_MODULE } from ".."

export type BrandClientOptions = {
  apiKey: string
}

type InjectedDependencies = {
  logger: Logger
  configModule: ConfigModule
}

export class BrandClient {
  private options_: BrandClientOptions
  private logger_: Logger

  constructor({ logger, configModule }: InjectedDependencies) {
    this.logger_ = logger

    const moduleDef = configModule.modules[BRAND_MODULE]
    if (typeof moduleDef !== "boolean") {
      this.options_ = moduleDef.options as BrandClientOptions
    }
  }
}
```

This creates a `BrandClient` service. Using dependency injection, you resolve the `logger` and `configModule` from the Module's container.

`logger` is useful to log messages, and `configModule` has configurations exported in `medusa-config.js`.

You also define an `options_` property in your service to store the module's options.

The `configModule`'s `modules` property is an object whose keys are registered module names and values are the module's configuration.

If the module's configuration isn't a boolean, it has an `options` property that holds the module's options. You use it to set the `options_` property's value.

<Note title="Tip">

If the service integrating the third-party system was a main service, it receives the module's options as a second parameter.

</Note>

### Integration Methods

Next, add the following methods to simulate sending requests to the third-party system:

export const methodsHighlights = [
  ["10", "sendRequest", "Since the third-party system isn't real, this method only logs a message."],
  ["19", "createBrand", "A method that creates a brand in the third-party system."],
  ["23", "deleteBrand", "A method that deletes a brand in the third-party system."],
  ["27", "retrieveBrands", "A method that retrieves a brand from a third-party system."]
]

```ts title="src/modules/brand/services/client.ts" highlights={methodsHighlights}
// other imports...
import { InferTypeOf } from "@medusajs/types"
import { Brand } from "../models/brand"

export class BrandClient {
  // ...

  // a dummy method to simulate sending a request,
  // in a realistic scenario, you'd use an SDK, fetch, or axios clients
  private async sendRequest(url: string, method: string, data?: any) {
    this.logger_.info(`Sending a ${
      method
    } request to ${url}. data: ${JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}`)
    this.logger_.info(`Client Options: ${
      JSON.stringify(this.options_, null, 2)
    }`)
  }

  async createBrand(brand: InferTypeOf<typeof Brand>) {
    await this.sendRequest("/brands", "POST", brand)
  }

  async deleteBrand(id: string) {
    await this.sendRequest(`/brands/${id}`, "DELETE")
  }

  async retrieveBrands() {
    await this.sendRequest("/brands", "GET")

    return []
  }
}
```

The `sendRequest` method is a dummy method to simulate sending a request to a third-party system.

You also add three methods that use the `sendRequest` method:

- `createBrand` that creates a brand in the third-party system. To reference a brand's type, you use the `InferTypeOf` utility imported from `@medusajs/types`. This transforms a data model, which is a variable, to its equivalent type.
- `deleteBrand` that deletes the brand in the third-party system.
- `retrieveBrands` to retrieve a brand from the third-party system.

## 2. Export Service

If the service integrating the third-party system is the module's main service, you only need to export it in the module definition.

However, since this service is an internal service in the Brand Module, you must export it in a `src/modules/brand/services/index.ts` file:

```ts title="src/modules/brand/services/index.ts"
export * from "./client"
```

This registers the service in the module's container, allowing you to access it in the module's main service.

---

## 3. Add Internal Service in Main Service

In the main service at `src/modules/brand/service.ts`, add the following imports and types at the top of the file:

```ts title="src/modules/brand/service.ts"
// other imports...
import { BrandClient, BrandClientOptions } from "./services"

type InjectedDependencies = {
  brandClient: BrandClient
}
```

Then, add the following in the `BrandModuleService` class:

```ts title="src/modules/brand/service.ts"
class BrandModuleService extends MedusaService({
  Brand,
}) {
  public client: BrandClient

  constructor({ brandClient }: InjectedDependencies) {
    super(...arguments)

    this.client = brandClient
  }
}
```

In the main module service, you first resolve through dependency injection the `brandClient` from the container and set it in a public property `client`.

---

## 4. Pass Options to the Module

To pass options in the module, change its configurations in `medusa-config.js`:

```js title="medusa-config.js"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  modules: {
    brandModuleService: {
      resolve: "./modules/brand",
      options: {
        apiKey: process.env.BRAND_API_KEY || "temp",
      },
    },
  },
})
```

A module's configuration accepts an `options` property, which can hold any options to pass to the module.

## Next Steps: Sync Brand From Medusa to Third-Party System

In the next chapter, you'll learn how to sync brands created in Medusa to the third-party system using a workflow and a scheduled job.
